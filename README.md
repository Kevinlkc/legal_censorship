# legal_censorship
### Background
China started publishing the universe of court verdicts as part of their legal reform since 2013. This endeavor is widely acknowledged as a cruicial step towards legal transparency, justice, and government accountability. However, starting from 2021, the government seems to be intentionally rolling back the commitment. Not only do we observe a huge dip in the total # of published verdicts, we also observe a considerable number of cases where previous court verdicts have been retracted. Out of the 80 million civil lawsuits published, over 2.5 million are retracted from the official website.

### Research question:
We're interested in understanding this unique phenomenon of legal censorship. Specifically,
- What kind of legal documents got censored?
- Why does local courts / government have the incentive to censor?
- What's the economic impact of such censorship?
